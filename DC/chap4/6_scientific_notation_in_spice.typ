=== Scientific notation in SPICE

The SPICE circuit simulation computer program uses scientific notation
to display its output information, and can interpret both scientific
notation and metric prefixes in the circuit description files. If you
are going to be able to successfully interpret the SPICE analyses
throughout this book, you must be able to understand the notation used
to express variables of voltage, current, etc. in the program.

Let\'s start with a very simple circuit composed of one voltage source
(a battery) and one resistor:

To simulate this circuit using SPICE, we first have to designate node
numbers for all the distinct points in the circuit, then list the
components along with their respective node numbers so the computer
knows which component is connected to which, and how. For a circuit of
this simplicity, the use of SPICE seems like overkill, but it serves the
purpose of demonstrating practical use of scientific notation:

Typing out a circuit description file, or #emph[netlist], for this
circuit, we get this:

```netlist
simple circuit
v1 1 0 dc 24 
r1 1 0 5  
.end
```

The line \"`v1 1 0 dc 24`\" describes the battery, positioned between
nodes 1 and 0, with a DC voltage of 24 volts. The line \"`r1 1 0 5`\"
describes the 5 Î© resistor placed between nodes 1 and 0.

Using a computer to run a SPICE analysis on this circuit description
file, we get the following results:

```table
node   voltage
(  1)   24.0000
```

```table
voltage source currents

name       current
v1       -4.800E+00

total power dissipation   1.15E+02  watts
```

SPICE tells us that the voltage \"at\" node number 1 (actually, this
means the voltage between nodes 1 and 0, node 0 being the default
reference point for all voltage measurements) is equal to 24 volts. The
current through battery \"v1\" is displayed as -4.800E+00 amps. This is
SPICE\'s method of denoting scientific notation. What its really saying
is $-4.800 times 10^0 "amps"$, or simply -4.800 amps. The negative
value for current here is due to a quirk in SPICE and does not indicate
anything significant about the circuit itself. The \"total power
dissipation\" is given to us as 1.15E+02 watts, which means $1.15 times
10^2 "watts"$, or 115 watts.

Let\'s modify our example circuit so that it has a 5 $k Omega$ (5 kilo-ohm, or
5,000 ohm) resistor instead of a 5 $Omega$ resistor and see what happens.

Once again is our circuit description file, or \"netlist:\"

```netlist
simple circuit
v1 1 0 dc 24 
r1 1 0 5k   
.end
```

The letter \"k\" following the number 5 on the resistor\'s line tells
SPICE that it is a figure of $5 k Omega$, not $5 Omega$. Let\'s see what result we
get when we run this through the computer:

```table
node   voltage
(  1)   24.0000
```

```table
voltage source currents

name       current
v1        -4.800E-03

total power dissipation   1.15E-01  watts
```

The battery voltage, of course, hasn\'t changed since the first
simulation: its still at 24 volts. The circuit current, on the other
hand, is much less this time because we\'ve made the resistor a larger
value, making it more difficult for electrons to flow. SPICE tells us
that the current this time is equal to $-4.800E-03$ amps, or $-4.800 times
10^-3$ amps. This is equivalent to taking the number -4.8 and
skipping the decimal point three places to the left.

Of course, if we recognize that $10^-3$ is the same as the metric
prefix \"milli,\" we could write the figure as -4.8 milliamps, or -4.8
mA.

Looking at the \"total power dissipation\" given to us by SPICE on this
second simulation, we see that it is $1.15E-01$ watts, or $1.15 times
10^-1$ watts. The power of -1 corresponds to the metric prefix
\"deci,\" but generally we limit our use of metric prefixes in
electronics to those associated with powers of ten that are multiples of
three (ten to the power of . . . -12, -9, -6, -3, 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.).
So, if we want to follow this convention, we must express this power
dissipation figure as 0.115 watts or 115 milliwatts (115 mW) rather than
1.15 deciwatts (1.15 dW).

Perhaps the easiest way to convert a figure from scientific notation to
common metric prefixes is with a scientific calculator set to the
\"engineering\" or \"metric\" display mode. Just set the calculator for
that display mode, type any scientific notation figure into it using the
proper keystrokes (see your owner\'s manual), press the \"equals\" or
\"enter\" key, and it should display the same figure in
engineering/metric notation.

Again, I\'ll be using SPICE as a method of demonstrating circuit
concepts throughout this book. Consequently, it is in your best interest
to understand scientific notation so you can easily comprehend its
output data format.
