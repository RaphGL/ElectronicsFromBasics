=== Ammeter design
A meter designed to measure electrical current is popularly called an
"ammeter" because the unit of measurement is "amps."

In ammeter designs, external resistors added to extend the usable range
of the movement are connected in _parallel_ with the movement
rather than in series as is the case for voltmeters. This is because we
want to divide the measured current, not the measured voltage, going to
the movement, and because current divider circuits are always formed by
parallel resistances.

Taking the same meter movement as the voltmeter example, we can see that
it would make a very limited instrument by itself, full-scale deflection
occurring at only 1 mA:

As is the case with extending a meter movement's voltage-measuring
ability, we would have to correspondingly re-label the movement's scale
so that it read differently for an extended current range. For example,
if we wanted to design an ammeter to have a full-scale range of 5 amps
using the same meter movement as before (having an intrinsic full-scale
range of only 1 mA), we would have to re-label the movement's scale to
read 0 A on the far left and 5 A on the far right, rather than 0 mA to 1
mA as before. Whatever extended range provided by the parallel-connected
resistors, we would have to represent graphically on the meter movement
face.

Using 5 amps as an extended range for our sample movement, let's
determine the amount of parallel resistance necessary to "shunt," or
bypass, the majority of current so that only 1 mA will go through the
movement with a total current of 5 A:

#image("static/00162.png")

From our given values of movement current, movement resistance, and
total circuit (measured) current, we can determine the voltage across
the meter movement (Ohm's Law applied to the center column, $E = I R$):

#image("static/10158.png")

Knowing that the circuit formed by the movement and the shunt is of a
parallel configuration, we know that the voltage across the movement,
shunt, and test leads (total) must be the same:

#image("static/10159.png")

We also know that the current through the shunt must be the difference
between the total current (5 amps) and the current through the movement
(1 mA), because branch currents add in a parallel configuration:

#image("static/10160.png")

Then, using Ohm's Law ($R=E/I$) in the right column, we can determine
the necessary shunt resistance:

#image("static/10161.png")

Of course, we could have calculated the same value of just over 100
milli-ohms ($100 m Omega$) for the shunt by calculating total resistance
($R=E/I$; $0.5 "volts"/5 "amps" = 100 m Omega$ exactly), then working the parallel
resistance formula backwards, but the arithmetic would have been more
challenging:

$
  R_"shunt" = 1 / (1 / (100 m) - 1/500) \
  R_"shunt" = 100.02 m Omega
$

In real life, the shunt resistor of an ammeter will usually be encased
within the protective metal housing of the meter unit, hidden from
sight. Note the construction of the ammeter in the following photograph:

#image("static/50025.jpg")

This particular ammeter is an automotive unit manufactured by
Stewart-Warner. Although the D'Arsonval meter movement itself probably
has a full scale rating in the range of milliamps, the meter as a whole
has a range of $plus.minus 60 "amps"$. The shunt resistor providing this high
current range is enclosed within the metal housing of the meter. Note
also with this particular meter that the needle centers at zero amps and
can indicate either a "positive" current or a "negative" current.
Connected to the battery charging circuit of an automobile, this meter
is able to indicate a charging condition (electrons flowing from
generator to battery) or a discharging condition (electrons flowing
from battery to the rest of the car's loads).

As is the case with multiple-range voltmeters, ammeters can be given
more than one usable range by incorporating several shunt resistors
switched with a multi-pole switch:

#image("static/00163.png")

Notice that the range resistors are connected through the switch so as
to be in parallel with the meter movement, rather than in series as it
was in the voltmeter design. The five-position switch makes contact with
only one resistor at a time, of course. Each resistor is sized
accordingly for a different full-scale range, based on the particular
rating of the meter movement (1 mA, 500 立).

With such a meter design, each resistor value is determined by the same
technique, using a known total current, movement full-scale deflection
rating, and movement resistance. For an ammeter with ranges of 100 mA, 1
A, 10 A, and 100 A, the shunt resistances would be as such:

#image("static/00164.png")

Notice that these shunt resistor values are very low! 5.00005 m立 is
5.00005 milli-ohms, or 0.00500005 ohms! To achieve these low
resistances, ammeter shunt resistors often have to be custom-made from
relatively large-diameter wire or solid pieces of metal.

One thing to be aware of when sizing ammeter shunt resistors is the
factor of power dissipation. Unlike the voltmeter, an ammeter's range
resistors have to carry large amounts of current. If those shunt
resistors are not sized accordingly, they may overheat and suffer
damage, or at the very least lose accuracy due to overheating. For the
example meter above, the power dissipations at full-scale indication are
(the double-squiggly lines represent "approximately equal to" in
mathematics):

#image("static/10163.png")

$
  P_(R 1) &= E^2 / R_1 = (0.5 V)^2 / (5.00005 m Omega) approx 50 W \
  P_(R 2) &= E^2 / R_2 = (0.5 V)^2 / (50.005 m Omega) approx 5 W \
  P_(R 3) &= E^2 / R_3 = (0.5 V)^2 / (500.5 m Omega) approx 0.5 W \
  P_(R 4) &= E^2 / R_4 = (0.5 V)^2 / (5.05 Omega) approx 49.5 m W \
$

An 1/8 watt resistor would work just fine for R#sub[4], a 1/2 watt
resistor would suffice for R#sub[3] and a 5 watt for R#sub[2] (although
resistors tend to maintain their long-term accuracy better if not
operated near their rated power dissipation, so you might want to
over-rate resistors R#sub[2] and R#sub[3]), but precision 50 watt
resistors are rare and expensive components indeed. A custom resistor
made from metal stock or thick wire may have to be constructed for
R#sub[1] to meet both the requirements of low resistance and high power
rating.

Sometimes, shunt resistors are used in conjunction with voltmeters of
high input resistance to measure current. In these cases, the current
through the voltmeter movement is small enough to be considered
negligible, and the shunt resistance can be sized according to how many
volts or millivolts of drop will be produced per amp of current:

#image("static/00165.png")

If, for example, the shunt resistor in the above circuit were sized at
precisely 1 立, there would be 1 volt dropped across it for every amp of
current through it. The voltmeter indication could then be taken as a
direct indication of current through the shunt. For measuring very small
currents, higher values of shunt resistance could be used to generate
more voltage drop per given unit of current, thus extending the usable
range of the (volt)meter down into lower amounts of current. The use of
voltmeters in conjunction with low-value shunt resistances for the
measurement of current is something commonly seen in industrial
applications.

The use of a shunt resistor along with a voltmeter to measure current
can be a useful trick for simplifying the task of frequent current
measurements in a circuit. Normally, to measure current through a
circuit with an ammeter, the circuit would have to be broken
(interrupted) and the ammeter inserted between the separated wire ends,
like this:

#image("static/00166.png")

If we have a circuit where current needs to be measured often, or we
would just like to make the process of current measurement more
convenient, a shunt resistor could be placed between those points and
left there permanently, current readings taken with a voltmeter as
needed without interrupting continuity in the circuit:

#image("static/00167.png")

Of course, care must be taken in sizing the shunt resistor low enough so
that it doesn't adversely affect the circuit's normal operation, but
this is generally not difficult to do. This technique might also be
useful in computer circuit analysis, where we might want to have the
computer display current through a circuit in terms of a voltage (with
SPICE, this would allow us to avoid the idiosyncrasy of reading negative
current values):

#image("static/00168.png")


```
shunt resistor example circuit
v1 1 0  
rshunt 1 2 1    
rload 2 0 15k   
.dc v1 12 12 1  
.print dc v(1,2)
.end    
```


```
v1            v(1,2)          
1.200E+01     7.999E-04
```


We would interpret the voltage reading across the shunt resistor
(between circuit nodes 1 and 2 in the SPICE simulation) directly as
amps, with 7.999E-04 being 0.7999 mA, or $799.9 mu A$. Ideally, 12 volts
applied directly across 15 k立 would give us exactly 0.8 mA, but the
resistance of the shunt lessens that current just a tiny bit (as it
would in real life). However, such a tiny error is generally well within
acceptable limits of accuracy for either a simulation or a real circuit,
and so shunt resistors can be used in all but the most demanding
applications for accurate current measurement.

#core.review[
- Ammeter ranges are created by adding parallel "shunt" resistors to
  the movement circuit, providing a precise current division.
- Shunt resistors may have high power dissipations, so be careful when
  choosing parts for such meters!
- Shunt resistors can be used in conjunction with high-resistance
  voltmeters as well as low-resistance ammeter movements, producing
  accurate voltage drops for given amounts of current. Shunt resistors
  should be selected for as low a resistance value as possible to
  minimize their impact upon the circuit under test.
