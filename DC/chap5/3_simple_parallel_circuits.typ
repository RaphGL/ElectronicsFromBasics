=== Simple parallel circuits
Let\'s start with a parallel circuit consisting of three resistors and a
single battery:

#image("static/00092.png")

The first principle to understand about parallel circuits is that the
voltage is equal across all components in the circuit. This is because
there are only two sets of electrically common points in a parallel
circuit, and voltage measured between sets of common points must always
be the same at any given time. Therefore, in the above circuit, the
voltage across R#sub[1] is equal to the voltage across R#sub[2] which is
equal to the voltage across R#sub[3] which is equal to the voltage
across the battery. This equality of voltages can be represented in
another table for our starting values:

#image("static/10070.png")

Just as in the case of series circuits, the same caveat for Ohm\'s Law
applies: values for voltage, current, and resistance must be in the same
context in order for the calculations to work correctly. However, in the
above example circuit, we can immediately apply Ohm\'s Law to each
resistor to find its current because we know the voltage across each
resistor (9 volts) and the resistance of each resistor:

$
  I_(R 1) &= E_(R 1) / R_1  \
  I_(R 1) &= (9 V) / (10k Omega) = 0.9 "mA" 
$
\    
$
  I_(R 2) &= E_(R 2) / R_2 \
  I_(R 2) &= (9 V) / (2k Omega) = 4.5 "mA" 
$
\    
$
  I_(R 3) &= E_(R 3) / R_3 \
  I_(R 3) &= (9 V) / (1k Omega) = 9 "mA" 
$

At this point we still don\'t know what the total current or total
resistance for this parallel circuit is, so we can\'t apply Ohm\'s Law
to the rightmost (\"Total\") column. However, if we think carefully
about what is happening it should become apparent that the total current
must equal the sum of all individual resistor (\"branch\") currents:

#image("static/00093.png")

As the total current exits the negative (-) battery terminal at point 8
and travels through the circuit, some of the flow splits off at point 7
to go up through R#sub[1], some more splits off at point 6 to go up
through R#sub[2], and the remainder goes up through R#sub[3]. Like a
river branching into several smaller streams, the combined flow rates of
all streams must equal the flow rate of the whole river. The same thing
is encountered where the currents through R#sub[1], R#sub[2], and
R#sub[3] join to flow back to the positive terminal of the battery (+)
toward point 1: the flow of electrons from point 2 to point 1 must equal
the sum of the (branch) currents through R#sub[1], R#sub[2], and
R#sub[3].

This is the second principle of parallel circuits: the total circuit
current is equal to the sum of the individual branch currents. Using
this principle, we can fill in the I#sub[T] spot on our table with the
sum of I#sub[R1], I#sub[R2], and I#sub[R3]:

#image("static/10073.png")

Finally, applying Ohm\'s Law to the rightmost (\"Total\") column, we can
calculate the total circuit resistance:

#image("static/10074.png")

Please note something very important here. The total circuit resistance
is only 625 Î©: #emph[less] than any one of the individual resistors. In
the series circuit, where the total resistance was the sum of the
individual resistances, the total was bound to be #emph[greater] than
any one of the resistors individually. Here in the parallel circuit,
however, the opposite is true: we say that the individual resistances
#emph[diminish] rather than #emph[add] to make the total. This principle
completes our triad of \"rules\" for parallel circuits, just as series
circuits were found to have three rules for voltage, current, and
resistance. Mathematically, the relationship between total resistance
and individual resistances in a parallel circuit looks like this:

$ R_"total" = 1 / (1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3) $

The same basic form of equation works for #emph[any] number of resistors
connected together in parallel, just add as many $1/R$ terms on the
denominator of the fraction as needed to accommodate all parallel
resistors in the circuit.

Just as with the series circuit, we can use computer analysis to
double-check our calculations. First, of course, we have to describe our
example circuit to the computer in terms it can understand. I\'ll start
by re-drawing the circuit:

#image("static/00092.png")

Once again we find that the original numbering scheme used to identify
points in the circuit will have to be altered for the benefit of SPICE.
In SPICE, all electrically common points must share identical node
numbers. This is how SPICE knows what\'s connected to what, and how. In
a simple parallel circuit, all points are electrically common in one of
two sets of points. For our example circuit, the wire connecting the
tops of all the components will have one node number and the wire
connecting the bottoms of the components will have the other. Staying
true to the convention of including zero as a node number, I choose the
numbers 0 and 1:

#image("static/00094.png")

An example like this makes the rationale of node numbers in SPICE fairly
clear to understand. By having all components share common sets of
numbers, the computer \"knows\" they\'re all connected in parallel with
each other.

In order to display branch currents in SPICE, we need to insert
zero-voltage sources in line (in series) with each resistor, and then
reference our current measurements to those sources. For whatever
reason, the creators of the SPICE program made it so that current could
only be calculated #emph[through] a voltage source. This is a somewhat
annoying demand of the SPICE simulation program. With each of these
\"dummy\" voltage sources added, some new node numbers must be created
to connect them to their respective branch resistors:

#image("static/00095.png")

The dummy voltage sources are all set at 0 volts so as to have no impact
on the operation of the circuit. The circuit description file, or
#emph[netlist], looks like this:

```
Parallel circuit
v1 1 0 
r1 2 0 10k
r2 3 0 2k
r3 4 0 1k
vr1 1 2 dc 0
vr2 1 3 dc 0
vr3 1 4 dc 0
.dc v1 9 9 1
.print dc v(2,0) v(3,0) v(4,0)
.print dc i(vr1) i(vr2) i(vr3)
.end
```

Running the computer analysis, we get these results (I\'ve annotated the
printout with descriptive labels):

```
v1            v(2)        v(3)        v(4)            
9.000E+00     9.000E+00   9.000E+00   9.000E+00
battery       R1 voltage  R2 voltage  R3 voltage
voltage       
```

```
v1            i(vr1)      i(vr2)      i(vr3)          
9.000E+00     9.000E-04   4.500E-03   9.000E-03
battery       R1 current  R2 current  R3 current
voltage
```

These values do indeed match those calculated through Ohm\'s Law
earlier: 0.9 mA for I#sub[R1], 4.5 mA for I#sub[R2], and 9 mA for
I#sub[R3]. Being connected in parallel, of course, all resistors have
the same voltage dropped across them (9 volts, same as the battery).

In summary, a parallel circuit is defined as one where all components
are connected between the same set of electrically common points.
Another way of saying this is that all components are connected across
each other\'s terminals. From this definition, three rules of parallel
circuits follow: all components share the same voltage; resistances
diminish to equal a smaller, total resistance; and branch currents add
to equal a larger, total current. Just as in the case of series
circuits, all of these rules find root in the definition of a parallel
circuit. If you understand that definition fully, then the rules are
nothing more than footnotes to the definition.

  - Components in a parallel circuit share the same voltage: 
    $E_"Total" = E_1 = E_2 = ... = E_n$

  - Total resistance in a parallel circuit is #emph[less] than any of the
    individual resistances: 
      $ R_"Total" = 1 / (1/R_1 + 1/R_2 +... 1/R_n) $

  - Total current in a parallel circuit is equal to the sum of the
    individual branch currents: $I_"Total" = I_1 + I_2 + ... I_n$.
