=== Safe meter usage

Using an electrical meter safely and efficiently is perhaps the most
valuable skill an electronics technician can master, both for the sake
of their own personal safety and for proficiency at their trade. It can
be daunting at first to use a meter, knowing that you are connecting it
to live circuits which may harbor life-threatening levels of voltage and
current. This concern is not unfounded, and it is always best to proceed
cautiously when using meters. Carelessness more than any other factor is
what causes experienced technicians to have electrical accidents.

The most common piece of electrical test equipment is a meter called the
#emph[multimeter]. Multimeters are so named because they have the
ability to measure a multiple of variables: voltage, current,
resistance, and often many others, some of which cannot be explained
here due to their complexity. In the hands of a trained technician, the
multimeter is both an efficient work tool and a safety device. In the
hands of someone ignorant and/or careless, however, the multimeter may
become a source of danger when connected to a \"live\" circuit.

There are many different brands of multimeters, with multiple models
made by each manufacturer sporting different sets of features. The
multimeter shown here in the following illustrations is a \"generic\"
design, not specific to any manufacturer, but general enough to teach
the basic principles of use:

#image("static/00340.png")

You will notice that the display of this meter is of the \"digital\"
type: showing numerical values using four digits in a manner similar to
a digital clock. The rotary selector switch (now set in the #emph[Off]
position) has five different measurement positions it can be set in: two
\"V\" settings, two \"A\" settings, and one setting in the middle with a
funny-looking \"horseshoe\" symbol on it representing \"resistance.\"
The \"horseshoe\" symbol is the Greek letter \"Omega\" (Î©), which is the
common symbol for the electrical unit of ohms.

Of the two \"V\" settings and two \"A\" settings, you will notice that
each pair is divided into unique markers with either a pair of
horizontal lines (one solid, one dashed), or a dashed line with a
squiggly curve over it. The parallel lines represent \"DC\" while the
squiggly curve represents \"AC.\" The \"V\" of course stands for
\"voltage\" while the \"A\" stands for \"amperage\" (current). The meter
uses different techniques, internally, to measure DC than it uses to
measure AC, and so it requires the user to select which type of voltage
(V) or current (A) is to be measured. Although we haven\'t discussed
alternating current (AC) in any technical detail, this distinction in
meter settings is an important one to bear in mind.

There are three different sockets on the multimeter face into which we
can plug our #emph[test leads]. Test leads are nothing more than
specially-prepared wires used to connect the meter to the circuit under
test. The wires are coated in a color-coded (either black or red)
flexible insulation to prevent the user\'s hands from contacting the
bare conductors, and the tips of the probes are sharp, stiff pieces of
wire:

#image("static/00341.png")

The black test lead #emph[always] plugs into the black socket on the
multimeter: the one marked \"COM\" for \"common.\" The red test lead
plugs into either the red socket marked for voltage and resistance, or
the red socket marked for current, depending on which quantity you
intend to measure with the multimeter.

To see how this works, let\'s look at a couple of examples showing the
meter in use. First, we\'ll set up the meter to measure DC voltage from
a battery:

#image("static/00342.png")

Note that the two test leads are plugged into the appropriate sockets on
the meter for voltage, and the selector switch has been set for DC
\"V\". Now, we\'ll take a look at an example of using the multimeter to
measure AC voltage from a household electrical power receptacle (wall
socket):

#image("static/00343.png")

The only difference in the setup of the meter is the placement of the
selector switch: it is now turned to AC \"V\". Since we\'re still
measuring voltage, the test leads will remain plugged in the same
sockets. In both of these examples, it is #emph[imperative] that you not
let the probe tips come in contact with one another while they are both
in contact with their respective points on the circuit. If this happens,
a short-circuit will be formed, creating a spark and perhaps even a ball
of flame if the voltage source is capable of supplying enough current!
The following image illustrates the potential for hazard:

#image("static/00344.png")

This is just one of the ways that a meter can become a source of hazard
if used improperly.

Voltage measurement is perhaps the most common function a multimeter is
used for. It is certainly the primary measurement taken for safety
purposes (part of the lock-out/tag-out procedure), and it should be well
understood by the operator of the meter. Being that voltage is always
relative between two points, the meter #emph[must] be firmly connected
to two points in a circuit before it will provide a reliable
measurement. That usually means both probes must be grasped by the
user\'s hands and held against the proper contact points of a voltage
source or circuit while measuring.

Because a hand-to-hand shock current path is the most dangerous, holding
the meter probes on two points in a high-voltage circuit in this manner
is always a #emph[potential] hazard. If the protective insulation on the
probes is worn or cracked, it is possible for the user\'s fingers to
come into contact with the probe conductors during the time of test,
causing a bad shock to occur. If it is possible to use only one hand to
grasp the probes, that is a safer option. Sometimes it is possible to
\"latch\" one probe tip onto the circuit test point so that it can be
let go of and the other probe set in place, using only one hand. Special
probe tip accessories such as spring clips can be attached to help
facilitate this.

Remember that meter test leads are part of the whole equipment package,
and that they should be treated with the same care and respect that the
meter itself is. If you need a special accessory for your test leads,
such as a spring clip or other special probe tip, consult the product
catalog of the meter manufacturer or other test equipment manufacturer.
#emph[Do not] try to be creative and make your own test probes, as you
may end up placing yourself in danger the next time you use them on a
live circuit.

Also, it must be remembered that digital multimeters usually do a good
job of discriminating between AC and DC measurements, as they are set
for one or the other when checking for voltage or current. As we have
seen earlier, both AC and DC voltages and currents can be deadly, so
when using a multimeter as a safety check device you should always check
for the presence of both AC and DC, even if you\'re not expecting to
find both! Also, when checking for the presence of hazardous voltage,
you should be sure to check #emph[all] pairs of points in question.

For example, suppose that you opened up an electrical wiring cabinet to
find three large conductors supplying AC power to a load. The circuit
breaker feeding these wires (supposedly) has been shut off, locked, and
tagged. You double-checked the absence of power by pressing the
#emph[Start] button for the load. Nothing happened, so now you move on
to the third phase of your safety check: the meter test for voltage.

First, you check your meter on a known source of voltage to see that its
working properly. Any nearby power receptacle should provide a
convenient source of AC voltage for a test. You do so and find that the
meter indicates as it should. Next, you need to check for voltage among
these three wires in the cabinet. But voltage is measured between
#emph[two] points, so where do you check?

#image("static/00353.png")

The answer is to check between all combinations of those three points.
As you can see, the points are labeled \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" in the
illustration, so you would need to take your multimeter (set in the
voltmeter mode) and check between points A & B, B & C, and A & C. If you
find voltage between any of those pairs, the circuit is not in a Zero
Energy State. But wait! Remember that a multimeter will not register DC
voltage when its in the AC voltage mode and vice versa, so you need to
check those three pairs of points in #emph[each mode] for a total of six
voltage checks in order to be complete!

However, even with all that checking, we still haven\'t covered all
possibilities yet. Remember that hazardous voltage can appear between a
single wire and ground (in this case, the metal frame of the cabinet
would be a good ground reference point) in a power system. So, to be
perfectly safe, we not only have to check between A & B, B & C, and A &
C (in both AC and DC modes), but we also have to check between A &
ground, B & ground, and C & ground (in both AC and DC modes)! This makes
for a grand total of twelve voltage checks for this seemingly simple
scenario of only three wires. Then, of course, after we\'ve completed
all these checks, we need to take our multimeter and re-test it against
a known source of voltage such as a power receptacle to ensure that its
still in good working order.

Using a multimeter to check for resistance is a much simpler task. The
test leads will be kept plugged in the same sockets as for the voltage
checks, but the selector switch will need to be turned until it points
to the \"horseshoe\" resistance symbol. Touching the probes across the
device whose resistance is to be measured, the meter should properly
display the resistance in ohms:

#image("static/00345.png")

One very important thing to remember about measuring resistance is that
it must only be done on #emph[de-energized] components! When the meter
is in \"resistance\" mode, it uses a small internal battery to generate
a tiny current through the component to be measured. By sensing how
difficult it is to move this current through the component, the
resistance of that component can be determined and displayed. If there
is any additional source of voltage in the
meter-lead-component-lead-meter loop to either aid or oppose the
resistance-measuring current produced by the meter, faulty readings will
result. In a worse-case situation, the meter may even be damaged by the
external voltage.

The \"resistance\" mode of a multimeter is very useful in determining
wire continuity as well as making precise measurements of resistance.
When there is a good, solid connection between the probe tips (simulated
by touching them together), the meter shows almost zero Î©. If the test
leads had no resistance in them, it would read exactly zero:

#image("static/00346.png")

If the leads are not in contact with each other, or touching opposite
ends of a broken wire, the meter will indicate infinite resistance
(usually by displaying dashed lines or the abbreviation \"O.L.\" which
stands for \"open loop\"):

#image("static/00347.png")

By far the most hazardous and complex application of the multimeter is
in the measurement of current. The reason for this is quite simple: in
order for the meter to measure current, the current to be measured must
be forced to go #emph[through] the meter. This means that the meter must
be made part of the current path of the circuit rather than just be
connected off to the side somewhere as is the case when measuring
voltage. In order to make the meter part of the current path of the
circuit, the original circuit must be \"broken\" and the meter connected
across the two points of the open break. To set the meter up for this,
the selector switch must point to either AC or DC \"A\" and the red test
lead must be plugged in the red socket marked \"A\". The following
illustration shows a meter all ready to measure current and a circuit to
be tested:

#image("static/00348.png")

Now, the circuit is broken in preparation for the meter to be connected:

#image("static/00349.png")

The next step is to insert the meter in-line with the circuit by
connecting the two probe tips to the broken ends of the circuit, the
black probe to the negative (-) terminal of the 9-volt battery and the
red probe to the loose wire end leading to the lamp:

#image("static/00350.png")

This example shows a very safe circuit to work with. 9 volts hardly
constitutes a shock hazard, and so there is little to fear in breaking
this circuit open (bare handed, no less!) and connecting the meter
in-line with the flow of electrons. However, with higher power circuits,
this could be a hazardous endeavor indeed. Even if the circuit voltage
was low, the normal current could be high enough that an injurious spark
would result the moment the last meter probe connection was established.

Another potential hazard of using a multimeter in its current-measuring
(\"ammeter\") mode is failure to properly put it back into a
voltage-measuring configuration before measuring voltage with it. The
reasons for this are specific to ammeter design and operation. When
measuring circuit current by placing the meter directly in the path of
current, it is best to have the meter offer little or no resistance
against the flow of electrons. Otherwise, any additional resistance
offered by the meter would impede the electron flow and alter the
circuits operation. Thus, the multimeter is designed to have practically
zero ohms of resistance between the test probe tips when the red probe
has been plugged into the red \"A\" (current-measuring) socket. In the
voltage-measuring mode (red lead plugged into the red \"V\" socket),
there are many mega-ohms of resistance between the test probe tips,
because voltmeters are designed to have close to infinite resistance (so
that they #emph[don\'t] draw any appreciable current from the circuit
under test).

When switching a multimeter from current- to voltage-measuring mode, its
easy to spin the selector switch from the \"A\" to the \"V\" position
and forget to correspondingly switch the position of the red test lead
plug from \"A\" to \"V\". The result -- if the meter is then connected
across a source of substantial voltage -- will be a short-circuit
through the meter!

#image("static/00351.png")

To help prevent this, most multimeters have a warning feature by which
they beep if ever there\'s a lead plugged in the \"A\" socket and the
selector switch is set to \"V\". As convenient as features like these
are, though, they are still no substitute for clear thinking and caution
when using a multimeter.

All good-quality multimeters contain fuses inside that are engineered to
\"blow\" in the event of excessive current through them, such as in the
case illustrated in the last image. Like all overcurrent protection
devices, these fuses are primarily designed to #emph[protect the
equipment] (in this case, the meter itself) from excessive damage, and
only secondarily to protect the user from harm. A multimeter can be used
to check its own current fuse by setting the selector switch to the
resistance position and creating a connection between the two red
sockets like this:

#image("static/00352.png")

A good fuse will indicate very little resistance while a blown fuse will
always show \"O.L.\" (or whatever indication that model of multimeter
uses to indicate no continuity). The actual number of ohms displayed for
a good fuse is of little consequence, so long as its an arbitrarily low
figure.

So now that we\'ve seen how to use a multimeter to measure voltage,
resistance, and current, what more is there to know? Plenty! The value
and capabilities of this versatile test instrument will become more
evident as you gain skill and familiarity using it. There is no
substitute for regular practice with complex instruments such as these,
so feel free to experiment on safe, battery-powered circuits.

#core.review[
  - A meter capable of checking for voltage, current, and resistance is
    called a #emph[multimeter],

  - As voltage is always relative between two points, a voltage-measuring
    meter (\"voltmeter\") must be connected to two points in a circuit in
    order to obtain a good reading. Be careful not to touch the bare probe
    tips together while measuring voltage, as this will create a
    short-circuit!

  - Remember to always check for both AC and DC voltage when using a
    multimeter to check for the presence of hazardous voltage on a
    circuit. Make sure you check for voltage between all pair-combinations
    of conductors, including between the individual conductors and ground!

  - When in the voltage-measuring (\"voltmeter\") mode, multimeters have
    very high resistance between their leads.

  - Never try to read resistance or continuity with a multimeter on a
    circuit that is energized. At best, the resistance readings you obtain
    from the meter will be inaccurate, and at worst the meter may be
    damaged and you may be injured.

  - Current measuring meters (\"ammeters\") are always connected in a
    circuit so the electrons have to flow #emph[through] the meter.

  - When in the current-measuring (\"ammeter\") mode, multimeters have
    practically no resistance between their leads. This is intended to
    allow electrons to flow through the meter with the least possible
    difficulty. If this were not the case, the meter would add extra
    resistance in the circuit, thereby affecting the current.
