=== Emergency response

Despite lock-out/tag-out procedures and multiple repetitions of
electrical safety rules in industry, accidents still do occur. The vast
majority of the time, these accidents are the result of not following
proper safety procedures. But however they may occur, they still do
happen, and anyone working around electrical systems should be aware of
what needs to be done for a victim of electrical shock.

If you see someone lying unconscious or \"froze on the circuit,\" the
very first thing to do is shut off the power by opening the appropriate
disconnect switch or circuit breaker. If someone touches another person
being shocked, there may be enough voltage dropped across the body of
the victim to shock the would-be rescuer, thereby \"freezing\" two
people instead of one. Don\'t be a hero. Electrons don\'t respect
heroism. Make sure the situation is safe for you to step into, or else
you #emph[will] be the next victim, and nobody will benefit from your
efforts.

One problem with this rule is that the source of power may not be known,
or easily found in time to save the victim of shock. If a shock
victim\'s breathing and heartbeat are paralyzed by electric current,
their survival time is very limited. If the shock current is of
sufficient magnitude, their flesh and internal organs may be quickly
roasted by the power the current dissipates as it runs through their
body.

If the power disconnect switch cannot be located quickly enough, it may
be possible to dislodge the victim from the circuit they\'re frozen on
to by prying them or hitting them away with a dry wooden board or piece
of nonmetallic conduit, common items to be found in industrial
construction scenes. Another item that could be used to safely drag a
\"frozen\" victim away from contact with power is an extension cord. By
looping a cord around their torso and using it as a rope to pull them
away from the circuit, their grip on the conductor(s) may be broken.
Bear in mind that the victim will be holding on to the conductor with
all their strength, so pulling them away probably won\'t be easy!

Once the victim has been safely disconnected from the source of electric
power, the immediate medical concerns for the victim should be
respiration and circulation (breathing and pulse). If the rescuer is
trained in CPR, they should follow the appropriate steps of checking for
breathing and pulse, then applying CPR as necessary to keep the
victim\'s body from deoxygenating. The cardinal rule of CPR is to
#emph[keep going] until you have been relieved by qualified personnel.

If the victim is conscious, it is best to have them lie still until
qualified emergency response personnel arrive on the scene. There is the
possibility of the victim going into a state of physiological shock -- a
condition of insufficient blood circulation different from electrical
shock -- and so they should be kept as warm and comfortable as possible.
An electrical shock insufficient to cause immediate interruption of the
heartbeat may be strong enough to cause heart irregularities or a heart
attack up to several hours later, so the victim should pay close
attention to their own condition after the incident, ideally under
supervision.

#core.review[
  - A person being shocked needs to be disconnected from the source of
    electrical power. Locate the disconnecting switch/breaker and turn it
    off. Alternatively, if the disconnecting device cannot be located, the
    victim can be pried or pulled from the circuit by an insulated object
    such as a dry wood board, piece of nonmetallic conduit, or rubber
    electrical cord.

  - Victims need immediate medical response: check for breathing and
    pulse, then apply CPR as necessary to maintain oxygenation.

  - If a victim is still conscious after having been shocked, they need to
    be closely monitored and cared for until trained emergency response
    personnel arrive. There is danger of physiological shock, so keep the
    victim warm and comfortable.

  - Shock victims may suffer heart trouble up to several hours after being
    shocked. The danger of electric shock does not end after the immediate
    medical attention.
